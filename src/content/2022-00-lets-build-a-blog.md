Tech jargon is a language no one grows up speaking. (put your sevant kid to work why don't you...)It can be painful to the ear for even the most hardcorde of us geeks. Who wants to learn a glossary of isoteric sounding names and acroymns? (you do! coming soon..) 

No pain, no gain. This won't hurt though :)
 
We'll develop and deploy a blazing fast website, and you can be an experience fullstack developer in minutes, with your own cloud CMS, github source control repository, automated builds and releases, and your own snazzy blog to share your adventures from. Or just read on and I'll do my best to educate, entertain and charm you through some geek speak.  and some activity that gives results (and dopamine :) so let's have some fun building you a blog you a modern blog you can manage from your phone or anywhere once live.
