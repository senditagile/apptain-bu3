Earn passive income by building a brand and online presence. Even if you're not technical, giving this a read or watch will be worth your time. They'll be a good amount of technobabble, and just going to jump right in, but'll teach and explain all the technojargon in plain english and they'll be a set of follow up posts to cover all of the basic to build up what we're going to put together here. 
Technical buzzwords can be painful to the ear for even the most hardcorde of us geeks. Who wants to learn a glossary of isoteric sounding names and acroymns? (you do?! coming soon..) No pain, no gain. This won't hurt though.
